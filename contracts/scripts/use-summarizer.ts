This wallet while I can see it needing to be replaced every few years for the battery potentially but certainly the buttons sake depending on usage. I think the peace of mind provided for $40 cost is well worth it if you deal in any substantial amount of crypto. While it doesn't offer everything it offers a lot compared to something like a ledger where you have all sorts of wallets but only 6 at a time. 3. Had this for a few months now. I keep it in my wallet and has been working good."
